# Application of augmented reality for crime scene investigation training and education

Holly, Vanessa, Wilkins., Val, Spikmans., Robert, Ebeyan., Brenden, Riley. (2024). Application of augmented reality for crime scene investigation training and education.   doi: 10.1016/j.scijus.2024.03.005

Abstract: The role of the crime scene investigator is complex, and investigators need to be able to conduct multiple frequently performed tasks. Appropriate training and education are critical to impart the crime scene investigator with the necessary capabilities. For a range of reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for multi-disciplinary capabilities, training and education requirements have evolved in recent times to be more flexible and accessible. The skills of a crime scene investigator can be broadly categorised into two types of fundamental skills: decision-making and psychomotor skills. Both these skills need to be taught and assessed within training and education programs. The most common approach to impart these skills is by incorporating a crime scene simulation facility; however, not everyone has access to these facilities. Furthermore, crime scene staff often undertake refresher courses and are required to complete proficiency assessments. Conducting these activities in a dedicated crime scene simulation facility is time consuming and costly. Virtual tools have been developed in recent years to address this, but these tools only assess decision-making skills and not psychomotor skills. This paper argues that the implementation of augmented reality (AR) technology should be considered in crime scene investigator training and university education, because it can provide significant advantages when paired with conventional methods of training and education. When appropriately managed, AR can provide an avenue of training where both decision-making and psychomotor skills can be addressed simultaneously, while providing a more flexible and accessible approach. The implementation of AR has the potential to significantly improve the standards of teaching, resulting in better equipped crime scene investigators. The paper will explore how AR has the potential to improve accessibility of training, increase safety, enhance the student experience, enhance collaboration and feedback through connectivity and potentially reduce cost. This paper will also provide an insight into what would need to be considered before implementing AR technology into crime scene investigation training and education alongside current approaches. It is argued that the inclusion of AR into the current training and education arsenal provides significant benefits that are worthy of exploration.

# The ART of CSI: An Augmented Reality Tool (ART) to Annotate Crime Scenes in Forensic Investigation

Jan, Willem, Streefkerk., M.M.J., Houben., Pjotr, van, Amerongen., Frank, B., ter, Haar., Judith, Dijk. (2013). The ART of CSI: An Augmented Reality Tool (ART) to Annotate Crime Scenes in Forensic Investigation.  330-339. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-39420-1_35

Abstract: Forensic professionals have to collect evidence at crime scenes quickly and without contamination. A handheld Augmented Reality (AR) annotation tool allows these users to virtually tag evidence traces at crime scenes and to review, share and export evidence lists. In an user walkthrough with this tool, eight end-users annotated a virtual crime scene while thinking aloud. Qualitative results show that annotation could improve orientation on the crime scene, speed up the collection process and diminish administrative pressure. While the current prototype suffered from technical limitations due to slow feature tracking, AR annotation was found to be a promising, usable and valuable tool in crime scene investigation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Mfundo, A., Maneli., Omowunmi, E., Isafiade.  3D Forensic Crime Scene Reconstruction Involving Immersive Technology: A Systematic Literature Review. IEEE Access, 10:88821-88857. doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3199437

Abstract: Recreation of 3D crime scenes is critical for law enforcement in the investigation of serious crimes for criminal justice responses. This work presents a premier systematic literature review (SLR) that offers a structured, methodical, and rigorous approach to understanding the trend of research in 3D crime scene reconstruction as well as tools, technologies, methods, and techniques employed thereof in the last 17 years. Major credible scholarly database sources, Scopus, and Google Scholar, which index journals and conferences that are promoted by entities such as IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, and SpringerLink were explored as data sources. Of the initial 17, 912 papers that resulted from the first search string, 258 were found to be relevant to our research questions after implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To summarize the existing efforts, we compared and analysed various classical 3D reconstruction approaches. This study presents the first comprehensive review of key milestones in the development of methods for 3D crime scene reconstruction, gaps for improvement and where immersive technology has been used to enhance crime scene findings. This study found that the implementation of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanners and immersive technologies, alongside traditional methods, has been beneficial in the recreation of crime scenes. The SLR is limited to existing applications with peer-reviewed papers published between 2005 and 2021. Results based on the analysed published data indicated that 20.2% of the articles implemented immersive technologies in crime scene reconstruction, of which Augmented Reality (AR) accounted for 15.3%, Virtual Reality (VR) accounted for 75%, Mixed reality (MR) accounted for 5.9% and VR and AR mixture accounted for 3.8%. Finally, we summarize the development trend of design and key technology prospects of crime scene recreation using immersive technology and provide insights into potential future research. To the best of the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first survey that accomplishes such goals.

# Augmented crime scenes: virtual annotation of physical environments for forensic investigation

Andrew, P., Gee., Ponciano, Jorge, Escamilla-Ambrosio., MW, Webb., Walterio, W., Mayol-Cuevas., Andrew, Calway. (2010). Augmented crime scenes: virtual annotation of physical environments for forensic investigation.  105-110. doi: 10.1145/1877972.1877999

Abstract: We describe a system aimed at the in-situ 3D annotation of physical objects and environments by the use of augmented reality. The system integrates absolute positioning technology, in the form of GPS and UWB positioning, with real-time computer vision to create a virtual 'incident map'. The virtual map is constructed collaboratively by multiple operatives and a remote control centre. We demonstrate the system operating in a test environment that covers indoor and outdoor areas and explain how the technology may be used to assist forensic investigators as they collect and process evidence in a crime scene.

# Enhancing Bloodstain Analysis Through AI-Based Segmentation: Leveraging Segment Anything Model for Crime Scene Investigation

Zihan, Dong., Zhengdong, Zhang. (2023). Enhancing Bloodstain Analysis Through AI-Based Segmentation: Leveraging Segment Anything Model for Crime Scene Investigation.   doi: 10.48550/arxiv.2308.13979

Abstract: Bloodstain pattern analysis plays a crucial role in crime scene investigations by providing valuable information through the study of unique blood patterns. Conventional image analysis methods, like Thresholding and Contrast, impose stringent requirements on the image background and is labor-intensive in the context of droplet image segmentation. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a recently proposed method for extensive image recognition, is yet to be adequately assessed for its accuracy and efficiency on bloodstain image segmentation. This paper explores the application of pre-trained SAM and fine-tuned SAM on bloodstain image segmentation with diverse image backgrounds. Experiment results indicate that both pre-trained and fine-tuned SAM perform the bloodstain image segmentation task with satisfactory accuracy and efficiency, while fine-tuned SAM achieves an overall 2.2\% accuracy improvement than pre-trained SAM and 4.70\% acceleration in terms of speed for image recognition. Analysis of factors that influence bloodstain recognition is carried out. This research demonstrates the potential application of SAM on bloodstain image segmentation, showcasing the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence application in criminology research.

# Automatic Classification of Bloodstains with Deep Learning Methods

Tommy, Bergman., Martin, Klöden., Jan, Dreßler., Dirk, Labudde. (2022). Automatic Classification of Bloodstains with Deep Learning Methods.  36(2):135-141. doi: 10.1007/s13218-022-00760-y

Abstract: Abstract The classification of detected bloodstains into predetermined categories is a crucial component of the so-called bloodstain pattern analysis. As in other forensic disciplines, deep learning methods may help to reduce human subjectivity within this process, may increase the classification accuracy, shorten the calculation time and thus, enable high-throughput analysis. In this work, an approach is presented in which a convolutional neural network (Inception v3) was trained from 965 drip stains (passive origin) and 1595 blood spatters (active origin). The trained CNN was evaluated with a test data set consisting of 366 images of drip stains and blood spatters. The success rate was 99.73% which suggests that neural networks could also be used to automatically classify other classes of bloodstain patterns to speed up the investigation process in the future.

# Toward Automatic Blood Spatter Analysis in Crime Scenes

A.R., Shen., G.J., Brostow., R., Cipolla. (2006). Toward Automatic Blood Spatter Analysis in Crime Scenes.  378-383. doi: 10.1049/IC:20060339

Abstract: Some scenes of violent crime contain blood stains. Blood spatter stains occur when blood falls passively due to force being applied to a body. There is a well established though extremely tedious technique by which a specially trained forensic technician can analyse the individual blood spots. This procedure estimates the body's 2D location on the floorplan when the body was impacted. Our image analysis algorithm contributes an automatic and accessible alternative that could be exploited at crime scenes, assuming the stains are known to be the result of spatter. This paper presents our approach and the results of comparative experiments we used to confirm the accuracy of the algorithm.

# Automatic Classification of Bloodstain Patterns Caused by Gunshot and Blunt Impact at Various Distances.

Yu, Liu., Daniel, Attinger., Kris, De, Brabanter. (2020). Automatic Classification of Bloodstain Patterns Caused by Gunshot and Blunt Impact at Various Distances.. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 65(3):729-743. doi: 10.1111/1556-4029.14262

Abstract: The forensics discipline of bloodstain pattern analysis plays an important role in crime scene analysis and reconstruction. One reconstruction question is whether the blood has been spattered via gunshot or blunt impact such as beating or stabbing. This paper proposes an automated framework to classify bloodstain spatter patterns generated under controlled conditions into either gunshot or blunt impact classes. Classification is performed using machine learning. The study is performed with 94 blood spatter patterns which are available as public data sets, designs a set of features with possible relevance to classification, and uses the random forests method to rank the most useful features and perform classification. The study shows that classification accuracy decreases with the increasing distance between the target surface collecting the stains and the blood source. Based on the data set used in this study, the model achieves 99% accuracy in classifying spatter patterns at distances of 30 cm, 93% accuracy at distances of 60 cm, and 86% accuracy at distances of 120 cm. Results with 10 additional backspatter patterns also show that the presence of muzzle gases can reduce classification accuracy.

# Towards Automatic Bloodstain Pattern Analysis through Cognitive Robots

Giovanni, Acampora., Autilia, Vitiello., Ciro, Di, Nunzio., Maurizio, Saliva., Luciano, Garofano. (2015). Towards Automatic Bloodstain Pattern Analysis through Cognitive Robots.  2447-2452. doi: 10.1109/SMC.2015.428

Abstract: Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is a forensic discipline that plays a key role in performing a reconstruction of the crime scene related to blood shedding events. By studying the distribution, size and shape of bloodstains, BPA supports worldwide investigation agencies (US FBI, Italian Carabinieri and so on) in identifying the dynamics of a certain act of violence and evaluating the credibility of statements provided by a witness, a victim, or a suspect. However, in spite of its importance, this forensic discipline is still mainly based on manual approaches, making the analysis of a crime scene long, tedious and potentially imperfect. This paper is aimed at presenting a proposal for a robotic framework to automate the BPA in all its steps. In particular, the robotic framework is composed of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of navigating the crime scene, detecting bloodstains, computing the points of origin and preparing a technical report describing the bloody event.

# 1.2. A novel approach to automated bloodstain pattern analysis using an active bloodstain shape model

Philip, Joris., Wim, Develter., Els, Jenar., Dirk, Vandermeulen., Walter, Coudyzer., Joke, Wuestenbergs., B., De, Dobbelaer., W., Van, de, Voorde., E., Geusens., Peter, Claes. (2014). 1.2. A novel approach to automated bloodstain pattern analysis using an active bloodstain shape model. Journal of forensic radiology and imaging, 2(2):95-. doi: 10.1016/J.JOFRI.2014.02.005

Abstract: Objectives Conventional blood pattern analysis is a tedious and time- consuming process due to the many actions that must be performed by the pattern analyst. Digital photographs can now be employed to aid in the process of scene analysis, by letting computer programs perform some of the required steps. However, current computerized methods are all based upon the assumption that any stain can be approximated by a simple ellipse, while manual work is still required. Materials and methods This work presents a novel approach, employing a regressed active shape model to approximate bloodstains. This Active Bloodstain Shape Model (ABSM) uses a regression to correlate the shape of a stain׳s approximation to its impact angle. This model is then deployed in a software pipeline, aiming to eliminate any user-input from the process. Fiducial markers are positioned in a crime scene, allowing for fully automated pattern analysis. Images are cleaned of any perspective distortions, after which stains are segmented and analyzed using said model. A robust principal component analysis (PCA) is then used to analyze the intersections of the reconstructed flight paths. Results Experimental results have demonstrated that the ABSM is able to better approximate stains, while accuracy on predicted impact angles is increased. Both simulated as well as real crimes scenes have confirmed the working of the automated pipeline. Conclusion Because the ABSM learns from experimental data, it is able to better approximate stains, resulting in an increased accuracy. The addition of the software pipeline removed the need for almost all user-input.

Abstract: Blood spatter analysis is a part of Criminal Justice system and subpart of the forensic science. Traditional blood spatter analysis has a problem with the crime scene contamination. The crime scene contamination can led to the unacceptance of the evidences. The blood spatter analysis is the process which heavily relies on the expertise of the forensic scientist. The human intervention also creates the problem of errors and misjudgments. Use of image processing to the whole will deal with automation of removing human factor. The proposed method takes the image from blood spatter using image processing and reconstructs the source of the blood. The proposed methodology uses the Otsu’s method for thresholding and Hough transform for edge detection.

# Leveraging Computer Vision in AI for Efficient Image Analysis in Case Investigations

Ying-Fai, Lam., Siu, Ming, Yiu., Yi, Wang. (2024). Leveraging Computer Vision in AI for Efficient Image Analysis in Case Investigations.   doi: 10.1109/iditr62018.2024.10554299

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach using computer vision algorithms for image analysis facilitating regulators" investigation. Digital evidence is rapidly increasing, originating from selected data viewed through forensic tools. While conventional tools use keywords and metadata search, they fall short of the expectation when it comes to multimedia images on phones. Visual inspection is still relied upon for image selection. Manual selection becomes limited in complex cases with increasing image volumes. The proposed method addresses these challenges through Object Detection, Face Detection, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Object Detection classifies evidence, Face Detection identifies associates and OCR extracts text for keyword search and personal information identification. This i2i (images to insights) method enables fast and relevant image selection, aiding prosecution and ensuring search scope adherence. It also assists in redaction and handling privileged claims in its extended use.
