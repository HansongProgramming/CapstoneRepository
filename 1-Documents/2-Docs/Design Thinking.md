### **Problem Challenge Statement:**       
Blood pattern analysis is a critical component of crime scene investigation, but it's often time-  consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. Traditional methods involve manual documentation and interpretation, which can lead to inconsistencies and delays in the investigative processes.

### **Empathize**

**Persona 1:**  Katrina Chagyowen, Forensic Science Student (University of the Cordilleras)
**Age:** 22
**Occupation:** 3rd-year Forensic Science Student
**Background:** Katrina is passionate about blood pattern analysis and dreams of contributing to major crime investigations. She is familiar with traditional forensic methods but is eager to learn more about advanced tools, especially AI and automation. However, she recognizes that her school primarily focuses on manual processes and traditional methods in their curriculum.

**POV:** As a forensic science student at the University of the Cordilleras, I want to learn about advanced technological tools for blood pattern analysis because I believe that relying solely on human judgment limits accuracy, and I want to be prepared for the future of forensics, even though the curriculum remains focused on traditional methods.

**Persona 2:** Christian Jallorina, Forensic Science Student (University of the Cordilleras)

**Age: 23**
**Occupation:** 3rd-year Forensic Science Student
**Background:** Christian is deeply invested in mastering traditional forensic techniques, particularly manual methods like blood pattern analysis. He believes that having a solid grasp of these methods is crucial before integrating technology. He is hesitant about using AI and automation in investigations, fearing it may lead to over-reliance and the loss of essential skills.
**POV:** As a forensic science student at the University of the Cordilleras, I want to first focus on mastering traditional forensic techniques because I believe having a strong manual skill set is crucial, and depending too much on technology might make future forensic scientists less capable in situations where tech is unavailable or unreliable.

**Persona 3:** Danie Montefalco, Forensic Science Student (University of the Cordilleras)
**Age: 21**
**Occupation:** 3rd-year Forensic Science Student
**Background:** Danie is passionate about forensic science but understands the financial limitations of her university. She recognizes the value of advanced forensic technology but knows that local agencies may not have the budget or access to these tools. As a result, she focuses on gaining practical skills that can be applied even with limited resources, while hoping for gradual integration of new technologies.
**POV:** As a forensic science student at the University of the Cordilleras, I want the curriculum to integrate technology gradually, without over-relying on it because I know that local forensic agencies may not have access to the latest tools, and I want to be prepared to work effectively even with minimal resources.

### **Solution**

**Solution 1:** Integrating automation through computer vision. 

**Solution 2:** Creating a system that integrates a general approach to pattern analysis taking the general concept and displaying its inferences towards the blood pattern through the use of computer vision and statistics.        

**Solution 3:** Using augmented reality and volumetric fluid simulation to emulate perpetuator and victims. In pursuit of visualizing crime through the use of modern technologies.

**Solution 4:** Creating an alternative method to conduct experiments/ forensic studies through the use of computer vision and augmented reality.

**Solution 5:** To develop a system that would integrate the necessary and enough features to give students a chance to simulate the use of equipment for educational purpose.
