### **Social Issue**:                  
Blood pattern analysis is a critical component of crime scene investigation, but it's often time-  consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. Traditional methods involve manual documentation and interpretation, which can lead to inconsistencies and delays in the investigative process.  
  
### **Software Solution**:        
An application that utilizes Computer Vision (CV) and Augmented Reality (AR) to assist Forensic Science students in simulating and automating processes in Blood Spatter Analysis.

### **Business Value**:             
The system will implement a business-to-business approach through licensure of the application to Universities and Research Institutions, allowing them to utilize the software across different organizations. Additionally, a business-to-consumer will allow individual users to create a one-time payment for the application.

| Human Error: Manual documentation and interpretation of bloodstain patterns are prone to human error, such as misjudgment of angles, distances, and the sequence of events. Time-Consuming Process: Traditional methods are often time-consuming, delaying investigations and potentially compromising evidence. Difficulty in Interpreting | **The limitations in current blood pattern analysis are primarily due to the reliance on human judgment and the lack of advanced technological tools. Human experts may introduce subjectivity and bias into their interpretations, while traditional methods are time-consuming and prone to errors.** | The limitations in blood pattern analysis persist due to the complex nature of bloodstain patterns and the ongoing challenges in developing and implementing advanced technologies. While significant advancements have been made, the field still faces hurdles in achieving fully automated and objective analysis. | Cost: Implementing AI-powered systems can be expensive, requiring significant investments in hardware, software, and training. Technical Challenges: Developing accurate and reliable AI models for blood pattern analysis can be technically challenging, particularly given the variability and complexity of bloodstain patterns. | Solving the limitations in blood pattern analysis is crucial for achieving justice. Accurate and timely analysis of bloodstain evidence can help to identify suspects, reconstruct crime scenes, and prevent wrongful convictions. By investing in advanced technologies, we can enhance the reliability and efficiency of forensic investigations, ultimately improving the outcomes of criminal cases. | **The limitations in current blood pattern analysis are primarily due to the reliance on human judgment and the lack of advanced technological tools.
